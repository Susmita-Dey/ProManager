## Issues & Pull Requests

### Creating an Issue

Before creating an issue for features, bugs, or improvements, please follow these steps:

1. Search for existing issues to avoid duplicates.
2. If the issue doesn't exist, create a new issue with a detailed description, selecting the appropriate issue type (e.g., bug, feature).
3. All issues are automatically labeled as "status: waiting for triage" and locked for comments.
4. If you want to work on the issue after it has been triaged and the label changed to "status: ready for dev," mention it in your issue description.

### Working on an Issue

Before working on an existing issue, please follow these steps:

1. Ask to be assigned only one issue at a time.
2. Look for the issue labeled "status: ready for dev" (if it doesn't have this label, your work might not be accepted).
3. Comment on the issue, requesting it to be assigned to you (avoid tagging maintainers on GitHub or Discord).
4. Once the issue is assigned to you, you can start working on it.
5. Only start working on the issue and open a pull request when it has been assigned to you to prevent confusion and duplicate work.
6. Do not enable GitHub Actions on your fork.
7. Reference the issue in your pull request (e.g., "closes #123").

> Notes:
> - Requests for assignment of issues made before the "status: ready for dev" label was added will not be considered.
> - Check the "Assignees" box at the top of the page to see if the issue has been assigned to someone else before requesting it.
> - Ask for clarification if an issue is unclear before requesting assignment.
> - Only request assignment for an issue you know how to work on.
> - An issue can be assigned to multiple people if they agree to collaborate on it.
